# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/d78015a4-6ce3-4ef5-a5b3-13bdcc40f648

## Development Standards & Conventions
This project follows specific coding standards and conventions:

- **File & Directory Names:** kebab-case (e.g., `invoice-list.tsx`, `purchase-orders/`)
- **React Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `InvoiceList`, `PurchaseOrderTable`)
- **Variables, Functions, Methods:** camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `invoiceData`)
- **Environment Variables:** UPPERCASE (e.g., `API_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`)
- **Exports:** Named exports for components

**Source of Truth:** Complete documentation of all conventions is maintained in:
- `docs/naming-convention-plan.md` - Naming conventions and migration plan
- `docs/documentation.md` - Documentation standards and JSDoc usage
- `docs/documentation-guide.md` - Guide to all project documentation

> **Documentation Approach:** We maintain comprehensive documentation in the `/docs` directory rather than scattered README files throughout the codebase. Component and hook documentation uses JSDoc comments directly in the source code, with only key modules having their own README files.

## Technology Stack

This project is built with:

- **Frontend Framework:** React + Vite with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** 
  - Shadcn UI (`@/components/ui/`)
  - Tremor for data visualization (`@/components/tremor/`)
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **State Management:** React Context

## Architecture

### Supabase-Only CRUD Architecture

All Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations in this project are handled directly via the Supabase client libraries and service layer. There is **no use of n8n, webhooks, or external automation** for database operations.

- All business logic and data synchronization are managed within the app or using Supabase features (such as Row Level Security and triggers).
- The service layer in `src/services/supabase/tables` provides type-safe, consistent access to all core tables.
- UI components must use this service layer for all data operationsâ€”no direct SDK calls or use of `any` types in components.
- This approach simplifies debugging, improves reliability, and ensures all CRUD actions are secure and auditable.
