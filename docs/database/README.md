## Overview

Our financial data is stored in a PostgreSQL database managed through Supabase. The data includes information about customers, invoices, expenses, payments, products, and more. This documentation provides resources for analyzing and visualizing this data.

## SQL Queries

The `queries` directory contains SQL queries for various financial analyses, including:

- Revenue analysis
- Cash flow analysis
- Profitability analysis
- Customer payment trends
- Expense analysis
- Accounts receivable aging
- Vendor spending analysis

See the [SQL Queries README](./queries/README.md) for detailed information.

## Database Schemas

The `schemas` directory contains information about the database tables and their relationships. Understanding the schema is essential for writing effective queries and analyzing data correctly.

See the [Database Schemas README](./schemas/README.md) for detailed information.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains practical examples of how to use the SQL queries in real-world scenarios, including sample visualizations and interpretations.

See the [Examples README](./examples/README.md) for detailed information.

## Diagrams

The `diagrams` directory contains visual representations of the database schema, data flow, and relationships between different financial entities.

See the [Diagrams README](./diagrams/README.md) for detailed information.
