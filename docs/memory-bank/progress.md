# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Set up infrastructure for Supabase-Glide sync:
   - Added core tables for Glide-to-Supabase sync (`gl_mappings`, `gl_connections`, etc.)
   - Implemented Glide-to-Supabase sync functionality
   - Created task-based workflow for sync implementation

2. ✅ Revised calculation logic for gl_accounts balances:
   - Changed vendor_balance calculation to `(Sum of related gl_purchase_orders.balance * -1)`
   - Simplified balance calculation to `customer_balance + vendor_balance`
   - Implemented via database triggers for automatic updates

3. ✅ Added Product Category Default Logic:
   - Created `set_default_product_category()` database function
   - Added `set_product_category_trigger` trigger
   - Set "Flowers" as default for NULL category values

4. ✅ Reorganized purchase orders and invoice hooks:
   - Implemented Feature-Based Architecture pattern
   - Created primary hooks with standardized implementation
   - Maintained backward compatibility for legacy hooks
   - Migrated to TanStack Query for data fetching and mutations

5. ✅ Enhanced PDF functionality:
   - Added PDF Preview Modal
   - Created PDF Share Link Component
   - Implemented PDF Caching System
   - Added Batch PDF Generation
   - Created PDF Management interface in admin section
   - Integrated PDF Failures Manager for error handling

6. ✅ Implemented payment tables and UI components:
   - Created gl_customer_payments table for invoice payments
   - Created gl_vendor_payments table for purchase order payments
   - Created gl_customer_credits table for estimate credits
   - Developed UI components for payment entry
   - Built entity-specific hooks for payment operations using TanStack Query

7. ✅ Standardized naming conventions:
   - Defined core principles for file, component, variable naming
   - Created consistent documentation standards
   - Implemented barrel files for component exports
   - Updated documentation to reflect new conventions

8. ✅ Developed service layer for Supabase:
   - Created typed service modules in `services/supabase`
   - Implemented consistent method naming patterns
   - Added proper error handling and type definitions
   - Updated hooks to use service layer
